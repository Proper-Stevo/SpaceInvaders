## Description

Space. Endless, always expanding (however that works) - the more we learn about our universe, the more we come to understand the vastness of that which we do not know. The <b><i><span style=color:#65C0FB>Orbital ODYSSEY</b></i></span> application aims shed some light on that vastness, beginning with our <i>Solar System</i>. Users may sign up and login to view information on each planet, such as density, orbit periods, average temperature, and the like. In addition, users can add notes to individual planet pages to aid in research, or to add new information or errata.

## Motivation

The team set out to create a MERN-based application that focused on displaying the basic details of each planet within the Solar System, with data for each planet being dynamically generated into their respective components. The app implements Node.js and several packages including, but not limited to, React, Express.js, graphQL, jsonWebToken  - all centered around an Apollo-based MVC-structure in support of an interactive and responsive app. The animated model was implemented with <i>three.js, react-three-fiber, and react-three/drei</i>.

## Usage

Click on `LOGIN/SIGNUP` atop the main page and follow the prompts. Once logged in, the user may navigate to each individual planet. From there, the user will see the details of the planet, along with a section for personal notes.
